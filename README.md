# AltStore Source

This repository hosts the AltStore source for Madonna. It includes the JSON metadata, icon, and other files required by AltStore so the source can be published and made available to users.

The main files are:

- `source.json`: Describes the source and lists the apps that can be installed through AltStore.
- `sourceicon.png`: Icon displayed in AltStore when users add this source.
- `CNAME` and other assets needed for hosting the source.

To add this source to AltStore, use the raw URL of `source.json` in the app.
